// Introduction - (This file is for practice problems and anything I find necessary to document)

// Programming is the act of constructing a program--a set of precise instructions 
// telling a computer what to do.

// A programming language is an artificially constructed language used to instruct computers.
// Like human languages, computer languages allow words and phrases to be combined new ways,
// making it possible to express ever new concepts. 

// The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity. A sense of what a good program
// looks like is developed in practice, not learned from a list of rules.

let total = 0, count = 1;
while (count <= 10) {
  total += count;
  count += 1;
}
console.log(total);
